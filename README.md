# Text Summarization

This project demonstrates **text summarization** using two different NLP approaches:

1. **Extractive Summarization (spaCy + word frequency method)**  
   - Selects the most important sentences from the original text.  
   - Works by calculating word frequencies and scoring sentences.  


2. **Abstractive Summarization (Hugging Face Transformers â€“ T5 model)**  
   - Generates new sentences that capture the meaning of the text.  
   - Uses a pre-trained deep learning model from Hugging Face.
